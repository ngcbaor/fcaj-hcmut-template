The VPC module (**createVpc**) is the simplest but most foundational module in the CDK codebase. Every other resource — ECS tasks, the ALB, EFS mount targets, Lambda (if it were in-VPC) — depends on the VPC existing first. It is always the first module called in the **AwsplaceStack** constructor.

#### Module overview

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| File | **lib/vpc.ts** |
| Function | **createVpc(scope: Construct): VpcOutput** |
| Resources | 1 VPC, 2 public subnets |
| Return type | **{ vpc: ec2.Vpc }** |

---

#### 1. VPC Definition

```typescript
export function createVpc(scope: Construct): VpcOutput {
  const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(scope, 'AwsplaceVpc', {
    maxAzs: 2,
    natGateways: 0,
    subnetConfiguration: [
      {
        name: 'Public',
        subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,
        cidrMask: 24,
      },
    ],
  });
  return { vpc };
}
```

#### Configuration breakdown

| Property | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **maxAzs** | **2** | High availability across two Availability Zones in ap-southeast-1 |
| **natGateways** | **0** | No NAT Gateway needed — ECS tasks use public IPs, Lambda is outside the VPC |
| Subnet type | **PUBLIC** | ECS tasks need direct internet access to reach DynamoDB, S3, and ECR APIs |
| CIDR mask | **/24** | 256 addresses per subnet, ample for Fargate task ENIs |

---

#### 2. Why No NAT Gateway?

This is a deliberate architectural decision that saves approximately **$32/month per NAT Gateway** (~$64/month for 2-AZ high availability):

| Reason | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **ECS tasks run in public subnets** | Fargate tasks use **assignPublicIp: true** — they reach AWS APIs directly, no NAT needed |
| **Lambda is NOT in a VPC** | The Lambda reaches DynamoDB, S3, SQS, and the ECS ALB over public AWS API endpoints |
| **Security at the SG level** | Network isolation is enforced by security groups, not by private subnet placement |

The standard AWS best practice of placing compute in private subnets behind a NAT Gateway exists for defense-in-depth. The awsplace project achieves equivalent security through tightly scoped security groups (see below) while avoiding the operational cost and complexity of NAT Gateways.

#### 3. Security Groups

Security groups are created in the modules that own the resources they protect — not in the VPC module itself. This keeps security rules co-located with the resource that needs them.

#### a) ALB Security Group (created in **ecs.ts**)

```typescript
const albSg = new ec2.SecurityGroup(scope, 'AlbSecurityGroup', {
  vpc,
  description: 'ALB security group - allow HTTP/HTTPS from anywhere',
  allowAllOutbound: true,
});
albSg.addIngressRule(ec2.Peer.anyIpv4(), ec2.Port.tcp(80), 'Allow HTTP from anywhere');
albSg.addIngressRule(ec2.Peer.anyIpv4(), ec2.Port.tcp(443), 'Allow HTTPS from anywhere');
```

The ALB is internet-facing — it accepts traffic from any IPv4 address on ports 80 and 443. Port 80 exists only to redirect to 443 (HTTP → HTTPS permanent redirect).

#### b) ECS Security Group (created in **ecs.ts**)

```typescript
const ecsSg = new ec2.SecurityGroup(scope, 'EcsSecurityGroup', {
  vpc,
  description: 'ECS security group - allow app port from ALB only',
  allowAllOutbound: true,
});
ecsSg.addIngressRule(albSg, ec2.Port.tcp(8980), 'Allow app traffic from ALB');
```

The ECS security group is locked down: it **only** accepts traffic on port 8980 from the ALB security group. Even though ECS tasks have public IP addresses, no direct internet traffic can reach them.

#### c) EFS Security Group (created in **raftdb-application.ts**)

```typescript
raftDb.fileSystem.connections.allowDefaultPortFrom(
  ecsSg,
  'Allow the application task to mount durable raftdb storage',
);
```

This rule allows the ECS task to mount the EFS filesystem on the standard NFS port (2049). Only the ECS security group can reach the EFS mount targets.

#### Security group chain

```
Internet
  │
  ▼
ALB SG (ports 80, 443 from 0.0.0.0/0)
  │
  ▼
ECS SG (port 8980 from ALB SG only)
  │
  ├──► ECS Task: App container (:8980)
  │         │
  │         └──► localhost:9100 → RaftDB sidecar
  │
  └──► EFS SG (port 2049 from ECS SG only)
         │
         └──► EFS mount target → /data/raftdb
```

No direct path exists from the internet to the ECS task or the EFS filesystem — all traffic must pass through the ALB.

#### d) RaftDB Staging Security Group (created in **raftdb-staging-stack.ts**)

For the staging stack, security group configuration depends on node count:

| Node Count | SG Configuration | Access Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **1 (single-node)** | TCP 9100 from **0.0.0.0/0** | Direct client access for qualification tests |
| **3 (three-node)** | TCP 9101 between members only | Internal Raft peer-to-peer only |

The single-node staging configuration intentionally opens port 9100 for qualification tooling. The three-node configuration is fully locked down for internal Raft peer communication.

---

#### 4. VPC Output and Consumers

The **createVpc** function returns a single object:

```typescript
interface VpcOutput {
  vpc: ec2.Vpc;
}
```

This **vpc** object is threaded through the stack constructor to every module that needs network placement:

| Consumer Module | How It Uses the VPC |
|---|---|
| **createIamRoles** | Does NOT use the VPC (IAM is global) |
| **createDatabase** | Does NOT use the VPC (DynamoDB is regional) |
| **createEcr** | Does NOT use the VPC (ECR is regional) |
| **createStorage** | Does NOT use the VPC (S3 is global) |
| **createLambda** | Does NOT use the VPC (Lambda is intentionally outside VPC) |
| **createApiGateway** | Does NOT use the VPC (API Gateway is edge-optimized) |
| **createAmplify** | Does NOT use the VPC (Amplify manages its own hosting) |
| **createEcs** | Uses VPC for: cluster, ALB, Fargate service subnet placement, security groups |
| **createRaftDbApplicationStorage** | Uses VPC for: EFS mount target placement |
| **createRoute53AndCertificates** | Does NOT use the VPC (DNS is global) |

Only **two modules** actually consume the VPC: ECS (for compute placement) and RaftDB Application Storage (for EFS mount targets). All other modules either operate at the regional/global level or are intentionally placed outside the VPC.
